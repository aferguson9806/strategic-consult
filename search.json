    "text": "The June/July Food Safety Insights in Food Safety Magazine presents Part 2 of our series on hygienic design and sanitation and what we heard from our global survey of 118 food processors in 23 countries.\nIn the good news, 81% reported having a designated “sanitarian” responsible for sanitation, but, as usual, the reality is often more complex as many report that they rely on a “team approach” while others report that their role of dedicated sanitarian has been eliminated due to resource constraints. Food safety professionals frequently have to juggle multiple responsibilities, and staff training and communication can be inconsistent, particularly when dedicated sanitarians are not maintained. Despite these challenges, most respondents give their facilities’ hygienic design and sanitation program a positive grade with 60% scoring between 6 and 9 on a 10-point scale. Find out more details in our Food Safety Insights column in the June/July issues of Food Safety Magazine\nHygienic Design: How are Processors Coping With This Essential Element of Food Safety? — Part 2 Food Safety Magazine June-July Food Safety Insights."
